# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a basic React site created using React and styled with Bootstrap CSS. I made this to practice ReactJS.

Getting Started
Pre-requisites: Vite requires Node.js version 14.18+, 16+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

Clone this repository.
Install dependencies and run the development server with npm:
npm install
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 on your browser to see the website. You can add --host flag to host it on your local network.
